# ReadMeIssuesModel

I believe the data collection is the main issue right now. The ReadMEs are not as nicely formatted as I expected. I wanted them to represent a sort of summary of the codebase but they would need extensive cleaning to actually work for that. The issues should also be further filtered to catch the more "project planning" issues.
